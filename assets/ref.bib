    abstract = {In the present scenario, our dependence on digitalized machines has increased a lot. To decrease it we need to handle the same dependence in a smarter manner. Therefore a Smart City is defined as the ability to integrate multiple technological solutions in a secure fashion to manage the city’s assets—the city’s assets include, but not limited to, local departments information systems, schools, libraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants, law enforcement, and other community services. The goal of building a smart city is to improve the quality of life by using technology to improve the efficiency of services and meet residents’ needs.},
